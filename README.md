In this practical, we will review some basics for using GitHub for version control.

As this is our final session, we wonâ€™t have another opportunity to review this practical as a group. However, I am happy to answer questions via email (J.Meisner@cgiar.org). 

All of the files needed for this practical are located in the Teams files for this webinar, and in this Dropbox link. They are:
- Item 1
- Item 2


## Problem 1: Getting set up in GitHub and GitHub Desktop
If you're here, then it sounds like you've completed problem 1!

## Problem 2: Cloning a repository

## Problem 3: Editing a .gitignore

## Problem 4: Editing README.md
Here is a useful resource on editing markdown files like this [README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings).
